MARIE-BOT
=============
(This is Marie's last commit. She was abandoned for BB, who improves a lot of what I set out to do with Marie.)
A Discord bot written in Discord.py for personal use, and sharing with friends.
She's meant to be my main server bot. I also user her to test different concepts
to see what I can do with a Discord bot. Includes a watchdog script for running
on Windows machines.

DEPENDENCIES
=============
Python 3.6.5

pip install discord.py

pip install weather-api

pip install ping3

NOTE
=============
The "temp.py" files must be edited and the underscore temp removed from the
name before the application will run.
