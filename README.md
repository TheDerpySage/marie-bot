MARIE-BOT
=============
A Discord bot written in Discord.py for personal use, and sharing with friends.
She's meant to be my main server bot. I also user her to test different concepts
to see what I can do with a Discord bot. Includes a watchdog script for running
on Windows machines.

DEPENDENCIES
=============
Python 3.5.2

pip install discord.py

BeautifulSoup

NOTE
=============
The "temp.py" files must be edited and the underscore temp removed from the
name before the application will run. Some of the emotes in assets aren't used.
Honestly, they should be removed but I'm a bit too lazy. There is one cog not
included in this public repo, but that's only because it contains some info about
my LAN.
